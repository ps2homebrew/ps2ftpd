 PS2FTPD - FTP Server for PS2

Licensed under the AFL v2.0. See the file LICENSE included with this
distribution for licensing terms.

Building:
---------

Building this project requires the following:

- A working IOP C compiler
- PS2SDK installed with $PS2SDKSRC set properly.

Just run make and if all went OK there should be a ps2ftpd.irx in the bin/
directory.

Running:
--------

Running requires that ps2ip.irx is already loaded. ioman.irx and iomanx.irx
are not directly required but highly recommended.

When starting the module, it will detach and start listening for incoming
connections on port 21. The server currently allows for up to 4 concurrent
connections.

If you're having trouble with "Unable to build data connection", it might be
that your version of ps2ip.irx is too old (the older versions did only allow
for 5 sockets at one time), please upgrade to a newer version in that case.
ps2ftpd will only in the worst case use a maximum of 4 sockets for
operation with one client connected.

Operation:
----------

The server understands the following commands:

USER <name>
PASS <password>
PASV
PORT <ipA>,<ipB>,<ipC>,<ipD>,<pH>,<pL>
QUIT
SYST
LIST <path>
NLST <path>
RETR <file>
TYPE A/I
STOR <file>
PWD
XPWD
CWD <dir>
CDUP
DELE <file>
XMKD <dir>
MKD <dir>
XRMD <dir>
RMD <dir>

Authentication is ignored, so be cautious if your PS2 is connected directly
to the internet.

Right now there's a temporary filesystem in place displaying both
memorycard-slots and the host (/mc0/, /mc1/, /host/). HDD is accessible if
mounted, but not listed in the device list and must be entered manually.
CDROM is as of yet untested.
