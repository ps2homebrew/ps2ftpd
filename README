 PS2FTPD - FTP Server for PS2

Building:
---------

Building this project requires the following:

- A working IOP C compiler
- PS2SDK installed with $PS2SDKSRC set properly.

Just run make and if all went OK there should be a ps2ftpd.irx in the bin/
directory.

Operation:
----------

ps2ftpd.irx requires that ps2ip.irx is already present. It accesses ioman.irx
and iomanx.irx, but does not absolutely require that they are present when
started. It hampers functionality greatly if they are not present or at least
loaded at a later time.

When starting the module, it will start listening for incoming connections
on port 21. The server currently allows for up to 4 concurrent clients. This
is configurable at compile-time if you need more.

If you're having trouble with "Unable to build data connection", it might be
that your version of ps2ip.irx is too old (the older versions did only allow
for 5 sockets at one time), please upgrade to a newer version in that case.
ps2ftpd will only in the worst case use a maximum of 4 sockets for
operation with one client connected.

Operation:
----------

The server understands the following commands:

USER <name>
PASS <password>
PASV
PORT <ipA>,<ipB>,<ipC>,<ipD>,<pH>,<pL>
QUIT
SYST
LIST <path>
NLST <path>
RETR <file>
TYPE A/I
STOR <file>
PWD
XPWD
CWD <dir>
CDUP
DELE <file>
XMKD <dir>
MKD <dir>
XRMD <dir>
RMD <dir>

Authentication is ignored, so be cautious if your PS2 is connected directly
to the internet.

The filesystem is unified, so you will find the first memory-card at
'/mc/0/', and a mounted hdd partition at for example '/pfs/0/'. The device
list show all devices present, but you may not access them all depending
on if they have implemented all required functionality. The unit list will
stop listing devices if the device is not present, so if you have a MC in
slot 1 but not in slot 0, the card in slot 1 will not show (but can be
accessed by going directly to '/mc/1/').
