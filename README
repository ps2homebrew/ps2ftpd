 PS2FTPD - FTP Server for PS2
 Copyright (c) 2004 Jesper Svennevid
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building:
---------

To build this project requires the following:

- A working IOP C compiler
- PS2SDK installed with $PS2SDKSRC set properly.

Just run make and if all went OK there should be a ps2ftpd.irx in the bin/
directory.

Running:
--------

Running requires that the following modules already are loaded:

ioman.irx
iomanx.irx
ps2ip.irx

When starting the module, it will detach and start listening for incoming
connections on port 21. The server currently allows for up to 4 concurrent
connections.

If you're having trouble with "Unable to build data connection", it might be
that your version of ps2ip.irx is too old (the older ones did only allow for
5 sockets at one time), please upgrade to a newer version in that case.
ps2ftpd will only in the worst case use a maximum of 4 sockets for
operation with one client connected.

Operation:
----------

The server understands the following commands:

USER <name>
PASS <password>
PASV
PORT <ipA>,<ipB>,<ipC>,<ipD>,<pH>,<pL>
QUIT
SYST
LIST <path>
NLST <path>
RETR <file>
TYPE A/I
STOR <file>
PWD
XPWD
CWD <dir>
CDUP
DELE <file>
MKD <dir>
RMD <dir>

Authentication is ignored, so be cautious if your PS2 is connected directly
to the internet.

Right now there's a temporary filesystem in place displaying both
memorycard-slots (/mc0/ and /mc1/). CDROM and HDD are inaccessible due to
incomplete support.
